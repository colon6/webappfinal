# webappfinal Daniel Powell & Hannah Colon

This is the code for the final project of Web Applications 2024, as of April 30th. There is the main folder, April 29th, which holds all of the php files, as well as the img folder. 


The starting page is index.php, which uses validate-login.php within it
createaccount.php uses dbinput.php within it

Homepage.php is the landing page after index.php is successfully passed. From this page, Marketplace.php, sell.php, account.php, checkout.php, and posts.php become available. All other php files are used within the previosly named files.
